# Alfin DAO Agent - Technical Documentation

This document provides technical details about the Alfin DAO Agent implementation, architecture, and current development status.

## Architecture Overview

Alfin is built with a modular architecture where each component handles a specific aspect of the system:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                   # Main application entry point
â””â”€â”€ modules/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ai/                    # AI integration
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ aiService.js       # OpenAI integration for natural language processing
    â”œâ”€â”€ blockchain/            # Blockchain interaction
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blockchainManager.js  # High-level blockchain operations

    â”œâ”€â”€ text/                  # Message processing
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ textProcessor.js   # Conversation state management
    â””â”€â”€ wallets/               # Wallet management
        â””â”€â”€ walletManager.js   # Secure wallet creation and storage
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Blockchain Integration

- **Contract Compatibility**: Uses OpenZeppelin's standard governance contracts (Governor + ERC20Votes)
- **Gas Management**: All gas fees are paid by an admin wallet, removing that friction for users
- **Key Functions**:
  - Token transfers (for onboarding and rewards)
  - Vote delegation
  - Proposal creation
  - Vote casting
  - Balance queries

### 2. Wallet System

- **Security Model**: PIN-based encryption for user wallets
- **Storage**: Local encrypted wallet files with SQLite database for mappings
- **Isolation**: Each user has their own wallet mapped to their Telegram ID

### 3. Telegram Bot

- **Library**: Official node-telegram-bot-api
- **Command Structure**: Menu-driven with button-based navigation
- **Privacy**: Sensitive operations only in private chats
- **Group Support**: Proposal announcements and voting in group chats

### 4. AI Integration

- **Provider**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Use Cases**:
  - User assistance
  - Explaining DAO concepts
  - Processing natural language queries
  - Help content generation

### 5. Database

- **Technology**: SQLite (lightweight, no external service needed)
- **Tables**:
  - `users`: Maps Telegram IDs to wallet addresses
  - `proposal_cache`: Optional caching for proposal data

## Current Status

### Completed
- âœ… Core architecture and module structure
- âœ… Basic blockchain integration with OpenZeppelin governance
- âœ… Wallet encryption/decryption system
- âœ… Command handling for basic DAO operations
- âœ… Conversation flow management
- âœ… Participation reward system

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Testing and validation
- ðŸ”„ Error handling refinement
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization

### To Do
- â¬œ Deployment documentation
- â¬œ Unit and integration tests
- â¬œ Monitoring system
- â¬œ Database migrations and backup
- â¬œ Advanced group voting features

## Implementation Details

### Security Considerations

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Private keys are never stored in plaintext
   - PIN is hashed using scrypt with salt
   - AES-256-CBC encryption for private keys
   - PIN messages are deleted after processing

2. **Permission Model**
   - Only the wallet owner can use their wallet
   - Admin wallet only used for gas fee payment
   - Delegation requires owner consent

3. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated
   - Rate limiting on PIN attempts
   - Telegram message IDs tracked to prevent replay attacks

### Blockchain Interaction Flow

1. **User Onboarding**:
   ```
   Join command â†’ PIN setup â†’ Wallet creation â†’ Token transfer â†’ Delegation
   ```

2. **Proposal Creation**:
   ```
   Proposal command â†’ Title input â†’ Description input â†’ PIN confirmation â†’ Blockchain submission â†’ Group announcement
   ```

3. **Voting**:
   ```
   Vote button â†’ Private chat redirection â†’ Vote selection â†’ PIN confirmation â†’ Vote submission â†’ Reward
   ```

## Dependencies

- `node-telegram-bot-api`: Telegram bot API client
- `ethers`: Ethereum interaction library
- `sqlite3`: SQLite database interface
- `openai`: OpenAI API client
- `crypto`: Node.js cryptography for wallet encryption

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several key areas:

1. **Custom Proposal Types**: The proposal creation system can be extended to support specialized proposal types.

2. **Multi-chain Support**: The blockchain service can be abstracted further to support multiple chains.

3. **Advanced Gamification**: The reward system can be expanded with achievements, levels, and more complex mechanics.

4. **AI Personalization**: The AI service can be enhanced to provide personalized responses based on user history.

## Known Limitations

- Currently supports a single DAO per bot instance
- Limited to EVM-compatible blockchains
- No support for hardware wallets or external wallet providers
- Group interactions are announcement-focused with redirection to private chats for actions
